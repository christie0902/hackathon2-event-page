        <h1>"PRAGUE CARNIVAL (MASOPUST) - FESTIVAL & PARADE"</h1>
        <p>"Prague Carnival (Masopust) traces its roots back to medieval times, and is a celebration of human
          joy
          and
          gregariousness. Set hours for the various events are not generally adhered to, everything is far too
          free
          spirited for that! Just spend time in the Lesser Town and if you see colourfully dressed people and
          hear
          loud
          music, you know the carnival has arrived. The Masks Parade is the most celebrated element of Prague
          Carnival. It
          starts at U Černého vola pub at Loretanske namesti near Prague Castle, winds down through the Lesser
          Town, and
          should arrive at Kampa Island around 3-4pm, where a party is held with live music and festival food
          and
          drinks
          on sale."</p>
